She’s Got Pretty Long Hair — Core Identity Anchor
This song represents the closest translation of my internal artistic identity into sound.
It is not a template.
It is not a draft.
It is not a target for optimization.
It exists as a reference point for emotional truth, tone, and intent.
All future ULE evolution is measured against this work — not at its expense.
