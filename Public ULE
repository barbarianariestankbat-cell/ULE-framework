3️⃣ PUBLIC-FACING ULE (ENTRY LAYER)
Purpose: let anyone access ULE without touching your protected core.
What ULE Is (Public)
ULE is an emotion-first creative framework.
It helps people make music from truth, not trends.
ULE does not teach technique.
ULE reveals intent — then lets sound follow.
Public ULE Intake (Phase 0 — Lite)
Anyone using ULE answers these before writing lyrics:
What feeling won’t leave you alone?
How intense does it need to be?
background / present / gripping / overwhelming / anthem
Is this:
real / memory / parody / fantasy / unsaid truth
What should the song do?
build / break / loop / erupt / quietly exist
Finish the sentence:
“This song gives me permission to ______.”
That’s the entire public gate.
Public Promise
Lyrics stay yours
Emotion leads composition
Genre is optional
No copying artists
No algorithm chasing
Tagline (pick later):
ULE it — emotion first.
Sound follows truth.
Find your ULE.
This layer is safe, shareable, scalable.
1️⃣ PHASE ZERO → SUNO TRANSLATION (CORE RULESET)
This is the non-negotiable operating rule.
🔒 RULE
Phase Zero NEVER goes in lyrics.
It goes ONLY in Style / Description.
ULE Phase Zero → Suno Style Template
Paste into Style:
Emotional core: � with �.
Intensity: �.
Emotional motion: �.
Vocal delivery: dynamic range, emotionally driven, human imperfection allowed.
Mood: honest, raw, intentional.
Priority: emotion over polish.
That’s it.
This is reusable forever.
Why This Works
No artist names → no flags
No genre lock → flexibility
Emotion anchors the generation
Lyrics remain untouched
This is the heart of ULE.
2️⃣ PHASE ONE — GENRE & ENERGY LENS
Phase One interprets Phase Zero.
It never overrides it.
Phase One Inputs
A. Energy
restrained
mid-energy
driving
explosive
B. Instrument Weight
minimal
band-focused
cinematic
experimental
C. Genre Lens (optional)
rock / metal / hip-hop / reggae / funk / electronic / classical / acoustic
Genre is a lens, not a cage.
Phase One → Suno Add-On (Style)
Example:
Instrumentation: guitar-driven, warm low end, organic drums.
Arrangement: slow build to emotional release.
Energy curve: controlled verses, powerful chorus.
Phase Zero + Phase One = identity preserved across styles.
