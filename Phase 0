ULE — PHASE ZERO (E0)
Emotional Orientation Protocol
Purpose
Phase Zero exists to identify why a song needs to exist before deciding how it sounds.
No genres. No artists. No tempo. Only emotional truth.
SECTION 1 — EMOTIONAL GRAVITY
(Circle or state the strongest one — not what sounds cool, what feels true)
☐ Love (earned, not fantasy)
☐ Longing / waiting
☐ Joy with sorrow underneath
☐ Rage with purpose
☐ Grief that still breathes
☐ Humor masking pain
☐ Celebration
☐ Defiance
☐ Healing
☐ Absurdity / parody
☐ Confusion
☐ Awe
Rule: If two compete, choose the one that hurts more.
SECTION 2 — EMOTIONAL INTENSITY (EOP SCORE)
Rate how hard this song needs to hit:
1–3 → background / reflective
4–6 → emotionally present
7–8 → gripping
9 → overwhelming
10 → anthem / life-defining
This number becomes the ULE EOP (Emotional Output Pressure).
Example:
“This song is a 9. I don’t want comfort — I want truth.”
SECTION 3 — TRUTH SOURCE
Where is this coming from?
☐ Lived experience
☐ Memory
☐ Fantasy / storytelling
☐ Parody
☐ Protest
☐ Tribute
☐ Confession
☐ Observation
Note: Parody is not “less real.”
It’s often more honest.
SECTION 4 — EMOTIONAL DIRECTION
Choose one primary motion:
☐ Rising (hope, power, arrival)
☐ Falling (loss, surrender)
☐ Circular (obsession, memory, loop)
☐ Expanding (growth, revelation)
☐ Exploding (release, chaos)
This tells ULE how the song should move, even across genres.
SECTION 5 — VOCAL INTENT (not skill)
This is not about pitch or talent.
☐ Controlled
☐ Breaking
☐ Whispered
☐ Shouted
☐ Spoken-sung
☐ Dynamic range (soft → explosive)
This directly informs vocal dynamics in prompts.
SECTION 6 — PERMISSION STATEMENT (CRITICAL)
Finish this sentence honestly:
“This song gives me permission to ________.”
Examples:
tell the truth
laugh at myself
miss someone
be vulgar
be sacred
be ridiculous
not explain myself
This sentence is the emotional key.
OUTPUT — ULE PHASE ZERO SUMMARY
When Phase Zero is complete, it compresses into one block:
ULE E0 Snapshot
Core Emotion: ______
EOP: __ / 10
Truth Source: ______
Emotional Motion: ______
Vocal Intent: ______
Permission: ______
This snapshot is what gets carried forward into every Suno prompt, every remix, every genre jump.
WHY THIS WORKS (important)
You never have to explain tone again
You don’t lose lyrical integrity
The music adapts to the emotion, not the other way around
Anyone can use ULE without becoming you
This is how ULE stays human.
