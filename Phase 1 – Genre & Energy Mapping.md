STEP 3 — Public-Facing ULE
“Find Your ULE” (Non-Technical, Human Entry Point)
This is what makes ULE scalable without diluting it.
Purpose
The public-facing ULE is not about making better songs.
It’s about helping people:
stop copying artists
stop chasing trends
stop hiding behind genre
And instead:
write from emotional truth
discover their voice
feel permission to create
Public ULE Entry (Plain Language)
What is ULE?
ULE is a creative system that starts with emotion, not sound.
It does not teach you how to make music.
It helps you understand why your song needs to exist.
Once you know that, any genre works.
The One-Minute ULE Intake (Public Version)
Answer honestly. There are no wrong answers.
What feeling won’t leave you alone right now?
(love, grief, humor, rage, longing, joy, confusion, etc.)
How intense does this need to be?
background
present
gripping
overwhelming
anthem-level
Is this:
real life
a memory
a joke
a fantasy
something you never say out loud
Should this song:
build
break
loop
explode
quietly exist
Finish this sentence:
“This song gives me permission to ________.”
That’s it.
That’s your ULE Phase Zero.
What ULE Promises (Public)
Your lyrics stay yours
Your emotion leads the music
You can change genres without losing identity
You don’t need technical skill to start
ULE does not:
write for you
copy artists
chase algorithms
Public Tagline Options
You can pick later, but these are strong:
“ULE it — write from the truth.”
“Sound follows feeling.”
“Emotion first. Everything else second.”
“Find your ULE.”
This section is safe to share publicly and doesn’t expose your deeper engine.
STEP 1 — Phase Zero → Suno Style Translation
(This answers the “where do I paste what?” question permanently)
You’re on the free version, so this matters.
Rule
Phase Zero never goes in lyrics.
It goes in Style / Description only.
Suno Style Prompt Formula (ULE-Compatible)
Paste something like this into Style:
Emotional core: longing with joy underneath.
Intensity: high, anthem-level.
Emotional motion: rising then breaking open.
Vocal delivery: dynamic range, intimate verses, explosive chorus.
Mood: soulful, raw, human, emotionally honest.
Prioritize feeling over polish.
That’s it.
Why it works
No artist names (avoids flags)
No genre locks
Suno still has freedom
Emotion stays dominant
You can reuse this forever, just swapping the emotional content.
STEP 2 — Phase One (Genre & Energy Mapping)
This is where variety without identity loss happens.
Phase One never overrides Phase Zero.
It only interprets it.
Phase One Inputs
A. Energy Level
Choose one:
restrained
mid-energy
driving
explosive
B. Instrumental Weight
Choose one:
minimal
band-focused
cinematic
experimental
C. Genre Lens (Optional)
Only add if useful:
rock
hip-hop
reggae
funk
electronic
classical
metal
acoustic
Genre is a lens, not a cage.
Phase One → Suno Style Add-On
Example add-on:
Instrumentation: guitar-driven, warm low end, organic drums.
Energy: slow build to powerful release.
Arrangement: clear emotional arc, space for vocals.
Combined with Phase Zero = your sound survives any genre.
